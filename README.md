# Mahalanobis distance based Out-of-Distribution samples detection

Full report: https://github.com/MohammedElm/OOD-Detection-using-Mahalanobis-distance/blob/main/Report.pdf

In this project, we  reproduced  the  main  results  presented  in  [1].    Thus,  we  built  from  scratch (using PyTorch) the Mahalanobis-based score with Input pre-processing and feature ensembling as suggested in [1].  Also, we re-trained from scratch a ResNet34 neural network [3] on CIFAR-10 [5], SVNH [6] and CIFAR-100 [5] datasets and evaluated the performance of the Mahalanobis-based score on different In-Distribution (ID) /Out-of-Distribution (OOD) setups. We achieve very comparable results to [1]. We have also conducted an ablation study to understand the correlation between validation accuracy of the NN and the performance ofthe mahalanobis score OOD detector. We found that the more well-trained a NN, the best is the performance of the score.  We studied the contribution of each layer of the ResNet to the overall performance and concluded that, counter-intuitively, the first layers are not necessary bad predictors but are actually good calibrators to the overall performance. Finally, we extended this score beyond Images-classification tasks by applying it to text data using a pretrained BERT BASE[7] model. In these experiments, we achieved good baseline performances. These experiments could be the ground for a more text-adapted confidence score. Future work could also explore how gradient-based input preprocessing could be implemented in a language model, such as BERT. The table below resumes our results on the setup ID=CIFAR10 and OOD=SVNH with Resnet34 model:

| Model  | ROCAUC | AUPRin  | AUPROut | Acc  | TNR AT 95% TPR | 
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Mahalanobis Single Layer with input-preprocessing at 0.005  | 98.5  | 96 | 98.8  | 93.8 | 93.1  |
| Mahalanobis Single Layer without input-preprocessing | 94.3  | 92.2  | 93.9  | 87.9  | 56.7 |
| Mahalanobis with feature ensembling and input-preprocessing at 0.005 | 98.9 | 98.3  | 99.3  | 97.6  | 97  |

Our code relies on the PyTorch and HuggingFace libraries.

```ResNet_train.ipynb``` is a notebook with all necessary steps to train a ResNet34 model on either CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 or SVHN. This notebook uses the class definition in ```resnet.py```

```Single_layer_experiments.ipynb``` is a notebook gathering all single-layer experiments, including appropriate hyperparameter fine-tuning and performance studies.

```Feature_ensemble.ipynb``` is a notebook implementing the feature-ensemble approach to OOD detection. This notebook first pre-computes Mahalanobis scores and saves them to disk, then measures performance.

```Ablation_study.ipynb``` is the implementation and visualization of our main ablation study, which is a sensitivity analysis of OOD detection performance to the base model's validation accuracy.

```BERT_experiment.ipynb``` contains all our text data experiments, using a BERT model. This notebook only relies on scripts from ```bert_utils.py```.

```BERT_finetune.ipynb``` allows to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for the downstream IMDB review classification task.

```mahalanobis.py``` gathers all scripts related to Mahalanobis score computing for images with ResNet, including input pre-processing, along with other useful functions.

```bert_utils.py``` gathers all scripts related to Mahalanobis score computing for texts with BERT, including input pre-processing, and other useful code.

```resnet.py``` contains the class definition of the ResNet model we use in the rest of our code.
